## Cluster Themes

Redraws the whole instrument cluster in a theme of your choice: a GT3 race dash, an M-style cluster, a Sport view, Minimal, Roadster round dials, Track, Drag with a 0 to 60 timer, Rally with a G-meter, Retro 80s, Cruise, or Dyno, a tile dash in BMW M colours. Pick the theme on the center screen, or let it follow the SPORT / COMFORT / ECO PRO buttons. [Read more](apps/cluster_themes/README.md)

## HUD Widgets

Puts your own readouts on the windshield HUD: gear, shift lights, boost, oil, coolant and intake temperatures, a G-meter and trip figures. Ten layouts, in Classic, M and Night colours (Cruise and Retro bring their own). [Read more](apps/idrive_hud_widgets/README.md)

## Install

1. Install **cluster-render** first. Both apps draw through it. It comes from the `robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps` Store source.
2. In the Store, go to **Settings, Add source**, enter **`ytx9i/over9-sport`**, and install the apps you want.
3. Open the app from the apps menu on the center screen to pick a theme or layout.

The Store builds each app on the car from this repo. No BMW code is in it. Both apps are tested on a 2020 X3 M40i; each app's page says what has been checked on the car and what is still open. Version history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
